## Dashboard Explanation

### **Predictive Model**

SecureCheck includes a form where users can input data for a new stop (e.g., stop time, country, driver age, gender, etc.) and predict the stop outcome and violation type based on historical data.

- The form includes the following fields:
  - Stop Date & Time
  - Country Name
  - Driver Information (Age, Gender, Race)
  - Search Conducted & Search Type
  - Drug-Related Stop
  - Stop Duration
  - Vehicle Number

Once the form is submitted, the app predicts the most likely violation and stop outcome, based on the existing dataset.

### **Prediction Summary**

After submitting the form, users receive a summary of the predicted stop, including:
- Predicted violation type
- Predicted stop outcome
- A textual summary of the predicted scenario

## Advanced Queries

The app also supports running advanced SQL queries directly from the dashboard. Examples of available queries include:

1. **Total Number of Police Stops**
2. **Count of Stops by Violation Type**
3. **Arrests vs. Warnings**
4. **Average Age of Drivers Stopped**
5. **Most Frequent Search Types**

These queries help to extract detailed insights and analytics from the police logs database.
